The Support Vector Machine methodology used was adapted from [Kaur et al, 2019](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/8/1613) and [this tutorial (though intended for building classification models, while ours is a regression)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7L0GsBiLQ). The method used to build a Bayesian Network was adapted from [Chaudhary et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09181).

The one major purpose behind studying human well-being and the factors affecting it has largely been centered around gathering valuable information that could help governments around the world maximize the well-being or life satisfaction of their citizens.

With the same, purpose, we used the data from the World Happiness report to build a Bayesian Network.
Paying close attention how the various factors of happiness affect each other (especially how government and economic factors can affect personal and social factors) may be beneficial when it comes to policy making to maximize the well-being of people. The Bayesian Network obtained from the data can be used for the same.

Multivariate Linear Regression analysis, do not possess the capacity to truly represent complex human psychology.
